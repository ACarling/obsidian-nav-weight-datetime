# Obsidian Nav Weight

> A sample plugin designed to sort files in navigation based on markdown frontmatter (also known as metadata) for Obsidian.

This plugin sorts files by recognizing the `weight` key defined in the markdown frontmatter, using its value as a criterion for ordering.

While there are several plugins available that offer customization of navigation, I created this particular plugin because others tend to be overly complex for a lazy person like me.

# Usage

## Step 1

define some `weight`s in your markdown files, like:
``` markdown
---
weight: 1
---
```

# Step 2

click the ![](./arrow-down-narrow-wide.svg) icon in the left ribbon.

**done!**
