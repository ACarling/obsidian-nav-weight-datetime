# Obsidian Nav Weight

A sample plugin designed to sort files in navigation based on markdown frontmatter (also known as metadata) for Obsidian.

This plugin sorts files by recognizing the `weight` key defined in the markdown frontmatter, using its value as a criterion for ordering.

While there are several plugins available that offer customization of navigation, I created this particular plugin because others tend to be overly complex for a lazy person like me.
